                    <p> I strongly believe that there is no such thing as a useless situation that you cannot 
                         learn from. This is probably my most important and valuable lesson I have learned in college, 
                         especially as a designer. Being a sponge, being open to unfamiliar experiences and 
                         interactions, and learning from feedback, constantly teaches me about new ways to problem solve, 
                         organize, and understand different points of view. My career aspirations hinge on this belief. I get 
                         many questions asking how public health/anthropology, human-centered design, and business are related
                         in any capacity. The truth is I wasn't sure until I began seeing problems and challenges in each sector
                         that could be solved by practices of another sector.   </p>
                    <h1 id="t-shaped">T-Shaped Designer</h1>
                    <p>My broad educational experience has allowed me to become what Tim Brown, 
                        CEO of IDEO, calls a T-shaped designer. My background in anthropology, 
                        human-computer interaction, and business allows me to approach design 
                        prompts and issues from many different angles and communicate with 
                        developers, researchers, and designers alike to better understand 
                        their needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>My specialization in anthropology gives me a deep understanding of 
                            human behavior, culture, and social dynamics, which helps me cultivate
                            thorough and endearing results in user research and testing. This, along 
                            with my experience in science writing and biology lab research, allows me 
                            to take dense or complicated findings and transform them into usable 
                            information for design solutions.

                    <p>There is a lot more I want to explore in design and communication! Currently, 
                        I am finishing off this website (the coding, design, and content process). I'm 
                        cleaning up my past projects and looking into new UX research-based projects 
                        in public health, specifically in fitness practices, stigmas, and culture 
                        (but Iâ€™m open to more). In addition to more self-led research, I am getting my 
                        data analytics certification to round out my SQL and Python experience. </p>
