                    <h1 id="prof-sponge">Interdisciplinary Thinker</h1>
                    <p>  Being open to unfamiliar experiences and learning from feedback constantly teaches me about new ways to problem solve, 
                         organize, and understand different points of view. I get 
                         many questions asking how public health/anthropology, human-centered design, and business are related
                         in any capacity. 
                         <br> <br> My answer is always the same: While these subjects do not seem related at first glance, there are applicable 
                         skills and knowledge from each subject that can assist my work in another.
                         <br><br>   I find that my interdisciplinary approach to issues has helped cultivate a unique approach to problem-solving, by 
                         facilitating open discussions between different groups of people. To me, understanding how groups work within a company - their 
                         goals, their strategies, their capabilities, and limitations - is essential for efficient and cohesive goal completion. </p>
                    <h1 id="t-shaped">T-Shaped Designer</h1>
                    <p>My broad educational experience has allowed me to become what Tim Brown, 
                        CEO of IDEO, calls a T-shaped designer. My background in anthropology, 
                        human-computer interaction and business allows me to approach design 
                        prompts and issues from many different angles and communicate with 
                        developers, researchers, and designers alike to better understand 
                        their needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>My specialization in anthropology gives me a deep understanding of 
                            human behavior, culture, and social dynamics, which helps me cultivate
                            thorough and endearing results in user research and testing. This, along 
                            with my experience in science writing and biology lab research, allows me 
                            to take dense or complicated findings and transform them into usable 
                            information for design solutions. 
                    </p>
                    <h1 id="hcd">Human-Centered Enthusiast</h1>
                    <p>My experience in business strategy taught me many valuable lessons about strategic marketing and 
                        product management/design. To me, the value of creating a relatable and endearing experience for 
                        users and consumers is of utmost importance when it comes to success. 
                        <br> <br>By combining my experience 
                        in anthropology with business I find that many strategic solutions can be found by understanding 
                        a customer base and exploring factors that determine how they use, buy, and perceive products. 
                        <br> <br></r>My experience in anthropology also assists me in making design decisions. Throughout my college 
                        education, I have performed school-related and personal ethnographies, teaching me how to ask the right 
                        questions and how to gain a deeper understanding of why people behave the way they do. 
                        <br> <br>I find that these experiences have greatly assisted me in UX research, as user testing, persona 
                        creating, and journey mapping often hinge on our perception of users and the data we collect from them.  
                    </p>
                    <h1 id="future">Future Endeavors</h1>
                    <p>There is a lot more I want to explore in design and communication! Currently, 
                        I am finishing off this website (the coding, design, and content process). I'm 
                        cleaning up my past projects and looking into new UX research-based projects 
                        in public health, specifically in fitness practices, stigmas, and culture 
                        (but Iâ€™m open to more). In addition to more self-led research, I am getting my 
                        data analytics certification to round out my SQL and Python experience. </p>
