                        holistically. I can empathize with users, conduct thorough research, and design solutions that not only meet

                    </button>
                    <p class="content"> The study of anthropology enriches my UX design approach by providing insights into 
                        diverse cultural perspectives, allowing me to create designs that resonate with a wide range of users. 
                        Understanding cultural nuances is crucial for developing inclusive and user-centric interfaces. 
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, human-computer interaction knowledge enhances my ability to craft interfaces that 
                        align with user behaviors and expectations, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience. 
                        The synergy between anthropology and HCI inspires me to create designs that funtion well and consider the 
                        cultural context, resulting in globally relevant user experiences.

                    </button>
                    <p class="content">In my problem-solving endeavors, I draw inspiration from the scientific method, 
                        a methodology deeply ingrained from my experience in research. This entails a commitment to systematic investigation 
                        and data-driven analysis. My interdisciplinary background, encompassing anthropology and operations/strategic 
                        management, further refines this approach. <br><br>Anthropology enriches the problem-framing process with a comprehensive 
                        understanding of user behaviors within diverse cultural landscapes. Concurrently, operations and strategic management
                         provide a strategic lens, ensuring solutions not only address challenges effectively but also align seamlessly with 
                         overarching organizational objectives.

                    </button>
                    <p class="content"> I try to continously learn throughout my career through active and passive activities. One of my favorite ways to learn is via 
                        UXRescue.Org and Nashville Entrepreneurial Center. Both of these activities give me the chance to interact with and learn from more 
                        experienced professionals. I also keep myself entertained with personal projects like desktop designs and website redesigns <br><br> 
                        My more passive learning activities include reading (<i>Design Anthropology</i> is one of my favorite books), listening to podcasts, like 
                        <i>99% Invisible</i> and <i>Future of UX</i>, and keeping up with emerging technologies via newsletters.

                        cleaning up my past projects and looking into new UX research-based projects 
                        in public health, specifically in fitness practices, stigmas, and culture 
                        (but Iâ€™m open to more). In addition to more self-led research, I am getting my 
                        data analytics certification to round out my SQL and Python experience. </p>
