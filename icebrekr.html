                            <h1>Overview</h1>
                        <p>This was a volunteer project for a local start-up called 
                            IceBrekr in Nashville. Icebrekr is a networking application, 
                            like a mix of LinkedIn and Instagram. The company came to Nashville 
                            Entrepreneur Center with their observations from beta testing. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Problem</h3>
                        <p>Beta test users often stopped the sign-up process very early on, and those who complete the 
                            sign-up process fail to edit the profiles or show any further activity on the app. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Root Cause</h3>
                        <p>The beta testing showed that users were put off by the complicated sign-in process and 
                            confusion about the app's purpose once they logged in, leaving users unsure about how to answer
                            certain questions and complete their profile.
                        </p>

                        <p>4 Days</p>
                        <h3>Primary Roll</h3>
                        <p>This was a self-led project where I used skills such as process improvement and business research to inform 
                            my designs, create low-fidelity mock-ups, test prototypes, and create a final product.

                                increasing the number of users that will sign up and complete their profiles. The application needs to have more 
                                explicit guidance and information aout the app.

                            <h3>If users aren't completing the Sign-in/Profile process, where are they stopping?</h3>
                            <p>Users often stopped when interacting with <span class="yellow-highlight"> LinkedIn's login button</span>  and the "Fill From LinkedIn Profile" button. 
                                <br>Additionally, when it came to the profile page many users stopped editing their profile <span class="yellow-highlight">after adding a picture.</span>
                                <br><br>The red circles indicate the most frequent final touchpoint of each page before the user quits.</p>

                            <h3>Why are users stopping at these prompts?</h3>
                            <p class="shorter">
                                The whole process is too confusing.
                                Even the slightest deferral of attention or unclear step that gets in the way can intimidate users into giving up or getting distracted. Minimizing confusion for the users is essential
                                since IceBrekr's substitutes (Like LinkedIn or Facebook) are the prevalent competitors in this space.
                                <br><br><span class="yellow-highlight">The cognitive processing cost of signing up outweighs the personal motivation to subscribe to yet another networking app. </span>

                                LinkedIn button simply did not work). Almost 50% of the users that didn't complete the sign-up processes claimed their confusion caused the deferral.

                                    <br><br>Other groups that should be considered are <span class="yellow-highlight">people entering a new industry, people looking for personal work (babysitting, personal assistant), or people

                                        <li><h4><span class="yellow-highlight">Users want more direction</span></h4><p>Users want a simple and direct tutorial on how to use IceBrekr before having to answer questions about thier profile.</p> </li>

                                            and recruiters (very wide range of people).</p>

The draw of IceBrekr is that its a location-based real-time variation of LinkedIn. This means
                                            that everything from profile creation to posting needs to be able to happen as quickly as possible. </p>

                                    <p>There are dozens of sketches that came out of this project because most of my initial ideation is hand drawn.
                                    During this sketching process I like to consider what I'm trying to accomplish with my layout and how visual principles
                                    can help. <br><br> For example in this project: <br><span class="yellow-highlight"> "I need to create 2 user flows. One is for a quick and simple login process with a limited amount of infromation to fill out. The second flow needs to be a tutorial (easily skippable/click through) that demonstrates 
                                        the app's capabilities."

                                <p>Using figma I created rough versions of my sketches. I like to build in the context of flows because it helps me really think 
                                    about the purpose of elements I'm putting on the page. <br> I created two flows, one detailing the users first login to a completed profile set up. The second flow 
                                    is demonstrating the users journey from home page tutorial to the users profile.
