                            <h1>Overview</h1>
                        <p>This was a volunteer project for a local start-up called 
                            IceBrekr in Nashville. Icebrekr is a networking application, 
                            like a mix of LinkedIn and Instagram. The company came to Nashville 
                            Entrepreneur Center with their observations from beta testing. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>The Problem</h4>
                        <p>Beta test users often stopped the sign-up process very early on, and those who complete the 
                            sign-up process fail to edit the profiles or show any further activity on the app. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>Root Cause</h4>
                        <p>The beta testing showed that users were put off by the complicated sign-in process and 
                            confusion about the app's purpose once they logged in, leaving users unsure about how to answer
                            certain questions and complete their profile.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Project Length</h4>
                        <p>4 Days</p>
                        <h4>Primary Roll</h4>
                        <p>This was a self-led project where I used skills such as process improvement and business research to inform 
                            my designs, create low-fidelity mock-ups, test prototypes, and create a final product. 
                        </p>

                        <h1>Asking the Right Questions</h1>
                        <h4>What is IceBrekrs Goal?</h4>
                        <p>By identifying a clear goal I can determine the questions I need to ask to extract the best
                            insights from the qualitative data IceBrekr provided. <br> <span class="yellow-highlight">The goal of this redesign is to create a user jounrey that is inuitive and easy naviage, therefore
                                increasing the number of users that have signed in an completed creating their account. </span>
                        </p>
                        <h4>So, if users aren't completing the Sign-in/Profile process, where are they stopping?</h4>
                        <p>Users often stopped when interacting with <span class="yellow-highlight"> LinkedIn's login button</span>  and the "Fill From LinkedIn Profile" button. 
                            <br>Additionally, when it came to the profile page many users stopped editing their profile <span class="yellow-highlight">after adding a picture.</span>
                            <br><br>The red circles indicate the most frequent final touchpoint of each page before the user quits.</p>

                        <h4>Why are users stopping at these prompts?</h4>
                        <p>
                            To put it simply, the whole process is too confusing.
                            Even the slightest deferral of attention or unclear step that gets in the way can intimidate users into giving up or getting distracted. 
                            <br><br><span class="yellow-highlight">The cognitive load cost of these roadblocks outweighs the personal importance of yet another social media app. </span>

                                <p>"I keep getting sent back to the original login page after using the LinkedIn button but none of 
                                    my information was showing up. I kind of just gave up after that, like thats just way too much work."

                        <p>Each UX case has different methodology needs. Thats the importance of data analysis skills 
                            in UX research. By knowing what I'm looking for I can determine which methodologies best fit my goal.

                                <p>These results were provided by IceBrekr, now they just need to be analyzed. This data provides 
                                    user's ability to complete a goal and helps us answer why users are stopping. </p>

                                I need to get a firm grasp on who would be using the app. This can tell us which design 
                                formatting will be most recognizable and usable in the apps context.

                                Lastly, I need to create an ideal user journey. In doing so I can complete a gap 
                                analysis, which will help me compare the current state of the app to IceBrekr's goals 
                                to pinpoint exact changes.
