                    <h4>What is a Smart Toilet?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The term smart toilet refers to the integration of novel technology with conventional toilets. 
                        I am focusing on toilets that can measure health parameters and has health monitoring capabilities.
                        Since this project was more speculative, the smart toilet capabilities were not limited to current 
                        health tracking technology that exists today. This allowed for heightened creativity but also challenged
                        me to create prototypes for complex data and information that I was not familiar with.

                    <p>
                        University X is interested in placing Smart Toilets throughout campus for post pandemic health 
                        related reasons and beyond/including tracking public health, student health, covid and other 
                        viruses, hydration and nutrition for all students.

                    <p>
                        Develop a customer facing interface that can be accessed from a kiosk or mobile device 
                        based on the research findings from interviews, surveys, and secondary research.

                   <p>There was a lot we needed to learn about our users for this project, such as 
                    the ideal smart toilet capabilites, common health practices, familiarity with biometric tracking and 
                    health technology, and privacy preferences.
