                    <h4>What is a Smart Toilet?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The term smart toilet refers to the integration of novel technology with conventional toilets. 
                        I am focusing on toilets that can measure health parameters and has health monitoring capabilities.
                        Since this project was more speculative, the smart toilet capabilities were not limited to current 
                        health tracking technology that exists today. This allowed for heightened creativity but also challenged
                        me to create prototypes for complex data and information that I was not familiar with.

                    <h5>We interviewed 10 students and created a survey that was shared on social media. Interviews lasted approximately
                        and hour and collected more detailed and elaborate feedback. 
                    </h5>
                    <p>In the interviews we asked opened ended questions about health and health tracking habits, privacy, and technological 
                        use to get a better understanding of how technology has been integrated into health practices. During the interviews 
                        we also did open and closed card sorting games in which interviewees sorted terms based on relation. This assisted in 
                        later design processes such as content organization.

                    <p>The survey was multiple choice and focued on questions like demographics, levels of comfort 
                        with health technology and virtual healthcare, and frequency of biometric tracking. In total there were 70
                        responses. Since we were a little pressed for time in this research we accepted answers from those who were
                        not students as well so we had enough infromation to inform our designs.

                There was a high volume of results to sort through, so I sorted the responses into four categories to make the

            <div class="row justify-content-center">
                <div class="col-8">
                    <h2>Privacy</h2>
                    <p>Health data is very personal, so privacy is a serious concern for most users. We recieved 
                        quite a few comments about the intimacy of using the restroom, as well as serious distrust for 
                        smart device companies and data security. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>"I'm very wary of providing any personal data to smart devices, regardless of what kind of privacy it might sell on the tin."</h5>
                    <p>Wash U Alum, 18-24</p>
                    <h5>"I do not like smart devices and do not trust the companies that make them with any sort of data security."</h5>
                    <p>Wash U Alum, 18-24</p>
                    <p>Additionally, when asked on a scale of 1 to 5 how comfortable they would be having a smart toilet use their biometrics to provide
                        personalized health data more than half the participants responded with a 3 or lower. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Key Take Aways:</h4>
                    <p>User's main concern is privacy. Numerous tech companies have fumbled the task of keeping intimate data secure, so users are often 
                        skeptical about the amount of control they have over their personal data. Providing simple and clear data privacy standards and allowing 
                        users to toggle privacy settings is essential. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Health Data/Biometrics Tracking</h2>
                    <p>This category of responses was primarily helpful in identifying our target users: people who already 
                        track their health data using existing technology such as fitness watches, mestrual cycle tracking, etc. </p>
                        <h5>77% of the participants already engage with some sort of health tracking tech.</h5>
                        <p>The remaining 23% were usually skeptical of data tracking and privacy, making the smart toilet a rather 
                            undesireable leap into health tracking technology adoption. 
                        </p> 
                        <h4>Key Take Aways</h4>
                        <p>The easiest audience to cater to will likely be those who already track their health data. Those who 
                            do not partake in health tracking for the sake of data privacy are probably even less likely to be accepting of 
                            a smart toilet. Brainstorming how a smart toilet might interact with other tracking devices will be useful when 
                            prototyping. 
                        </p>
                    <h2>Uses</h2>
                    <p>Since this was a speculative project, we gave participants the opportunity to suggest health tracking 
                        capabilites they would like (regardless of whether those capabilites could be accomplished with current accesbile
                        technology). 
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        The top responses were: 
                        <ol>
                            <li> Hydration - 73% </li>
                            <li> Nutrition - 65% </li>
                            <li> Glucose Levels - 40% </li>
                            <li> Period Tracking - 38% </li>
                            <li> Blood Pressure - 36% </li>
                            <li> Pregnancy - 30% </li>
                            <li> STD Risk - 30% </li>
                        </ol>
                        Additionally, 54% of participants were interested in tracking "other more advanced health (cancer risk, disease risk)"
                    </h5>
                    <h4>Key Take Aways</h4>
                    <p>
                        People are focused on hydration, nutrition, and glucose levels, which are strong indicators
                        of overall health. The significant interest in hydration and nutrition tracking likely stems from the fact 
                        that there is a shortage of technology that can track these simply, quickly, and accurately. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Reliability</h2>
                    <p>When handling sensitive and complex data it is extremely important for it to be 
                        easily digestable and manageable. This means that the structure and data vizualization
                        should of this app should be recognizable and easy to navigate. In this case, paying attention
                        to the card sorting results and drawing inspiration from other recognizeable health tracking brands
                        is extremely important in making a well designed app.
