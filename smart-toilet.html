                        <p>This is the final project I completed for my UX Research Methods class. 
                        <br><br>
                            During this course I leared the basics
                            of the UX research and design process, such as conducting interviews and surveys, and using research 
                            insights to inform user personas, journey mapping, and ultimately design feature prototypes.

                        <h4>The Prompt</h4>
                        <p>
                            University X is interested in placing Smart Toilets throughout campus for post pandemic health 
                            related reasons and beyond/including tracking public health, student health, covid and other 
                            viruses, hydration and nutrition for all students.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-3">
                        <h4>What is a Smart Toilet?</h4>
                        <p>
                            I focus on toilets that have health monitoring capabilities, such as hydration measurements and cancer
                            screening.
                            <br><br>
                            Since this project was more speculative, the smart toilet capabilities were not limited to current 
                            health tracking technology thats acceptable today. This allowed for heightened creativity but also challenged
                            me to create prototypes for complex data and information that I was not familiar with.

                    <p>There was a lot we needed to learn about our users for this project, such as 
                        health practices, familiarity with biometric tracking and health technology, privacy preferences, 
                        and what they consider ideal smart toilet capabilites.

                            we also did open and closed card sorting games in which interviewees sorted terms based on relation. This assisted in

                            <p>Health data is very personal, so privacy is a serious concern for most users. We recieved 
                                quite a few comments about the intimacy of using the restroom, as well as serious distrust for 
                                smart device companies and data security.

                            <p>Additionally, when asked on a scale of 1 to 5 how comfortable they would be having a smart toilet use their biometrics to provide
                                personalized health data more than half the participants responded with a 3 or lower.

                            <p>User's main concern is privacy. Numerous tech companies have fumbled the task of keeping intimate data secure, so users are often 
                                skeptical about the amount of control they have over their personal data. Providing simple and clear data privacy standards and allowing 
                                users to toggle privacy settings is essential.

                                <p>This category of responses was primarily helpful in identifying our target users: people who already 
                                track their health data using existing technology such as fitness watches, mestrual cycle tracking, etc. </p>
                                <h5>77% of the participants already engage with some sort of health tracking tech.</h5>
                                <p>The remaining 23% were usually skeptical of data tracking and privacy, making the smart toilet a rather 
                                    undesireable leap into health tracking technology adoption. 
                                </p> 
                            <h4>Key Take Aways</h4>
                                <p>The easiest audience to cater to will likely be those who already track their health data. Those who 
                                    do not partake in health tracking for the sake of data privacy are probably even less likely to be accepting of 
                                    a smart toilet. Brainstorming how a smart toilet might interact with other tracking devices will be useful when 
                                    prototyping.

                                <p>
                                People are focused on hydration, nutrition, and glucose levels, which are strong indicators
                                of overall health. The significant interest in hydration and nutrition tracking likely stems from the fact 
                                that there is a shortage of technology that can track these simply, quickly, and accurately.

                                <p>When handling sensitive and complex data it is extremely important for it to be 
                                    easily digestable and manageable. This means that the structure and data vizualization
                                    should of this app should be recognizable and easy to navigate. In this case, paying attention
                                    to the card sorting results and drawing inspiration from other recognizeable health tracking brands
                                    is extremely important in making a well designed app.

                            to consolidate their data into one space.

                            receives more information about that specific statistic, and sets a reminder for the user to monitor or

                            <p>Catered to a wide range of users with varied motivations for use.</p>
                        <h1>Reflection</h1>
                            <p>I learned a lot from this project, like how to take user research and apply the results to design 
                                principles, user personas and stories, and feature designs. </p>
                                <p>One of the skills I think I improved on 
                                most was user testing and using user feedback constructively.Having to iterate through multiple designs
                                and find creative ways to make the application easy to understand and usable was a bit more of a 
                                challenge than I expected, but it was such an endearing and interesting process. </p>
                                
                            <p>In addition to the UX research process, I also learned a lot about design tools. I learned so much about Figma and its design functions including 
                                how to add interaction and utilize its prototype functions. Overall, I am happy about my current final product, and 
                                hope to elaborate on this prototype. I cannot wait to apply my knowledge and learn more from future projects 
                                resembling this one.
